## ListenerOptions.prefetch property

Sets how many messages the endpoint will pull off of the queue to process locally. Setting this to `0` disables prefetch and consumers will pull an unlimited number of items from the queue.

Unlimited prefetch should be used with care. Endpoints can pull messages faster than they can deal with them, resulting in rapid memory consumption growth.

Values in the `100` through `300` range usually offer optimal throughput and do not run significant risk of overwhelming consumers. Higher values often run in to the law of diminishing returns.

Defaults to 48.
