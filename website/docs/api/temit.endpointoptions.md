## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [prefetch](./temit.endpointoptions.prefetch.md) | number | Sets how many messages the endpoint will pull off of the queue to process locally. Setting this to <code>0</code> disables prefetch and consumers will pull an unlimited number of items from the queue.<!-- -->Unlimited prefetch should be used with care. Endpoints can pull messages faster than they can deal with them, resulting in rapid memory consumption growth.<!-- -->Values in the <code>100</code> through <code>300</code> range usually offer optimal throughput and do not run significant risk of overwhelming consumers. Higher values often run in to the law of diminishing returns.<!-- -->Defaults to 48. |
