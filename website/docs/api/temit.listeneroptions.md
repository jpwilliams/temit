## ListenerOptions interface


<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface ListenerOptions 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [buffer](./temit.listeneroptions.buffer.md) | boolean | Sets whether or not the listener should buffer incoming messages should it go offline. This (<code>true</code>) is the default behaviour.<!-- -->If <code>buffer</code> is set to <code>false</code>, the listener will behave more like a regular pub/sub communication method; it will only receive messages while it's listening, and will miss all messages that are sent while it's not.<!-- -->This can be useful if you wish to temporarily tap in to an emission or for high-load, non-critical listeners. |
|  [group](./temit.listeneroptions.group.md) | string | Sets the string used to group listeners together for scaling purposes.<!-- -->This defaults to an incrementing numeric ID, though this can cause race conditions for code that asynchronously creates listeners.<!-- -->If this is the case, set the group here for safety. |
|  [prefetch](./temit.listeneroptions.prefetch.md) | number | Sets how many messages the endpoint will pull off of the queue to process locally. Setting this to <code>0</code> disables prefetch and consumers will pull an unlimited number of items from the queue.<!-- -->Unlimited prefetch should be used with care. Endpoints can pull messages faster than they can deal with them, resulting in rapid memory consumption growth.<!-- -->Values in the <code>100</code> through <code>300</code> range usually offer optimal throughput and do not run significant risk of overwhelming consumers. Higher values often run in to the law of diminishing returns.<!-- -->Defaults to 48. |
